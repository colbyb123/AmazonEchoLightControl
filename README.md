# Amazon Echo Light Control
Utilize Amazon's Developer Console to add a new skill to the Echo: turning on a LED connected to a Raspberry Pi. This uses the console's JSON output and a Ngrok connection from the Raspberry Pi along with a Python script running on the Pi. The LED connection can be any circuit or a smarter LED string light with various colors or settings.
